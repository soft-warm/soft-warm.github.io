      Calm. Inazuma was, calm. From the perspective of newly-landed travelers, there would appear to be absolutely nothing wrong, in Ritou. And for those natives of the city proper, the last month had seen a reprieve. The fight against the rebels was apparently going well, the number of people suddenly vanishing, the number of people losing their visions, had dwindled to a crawl.

      Ayaka, tired, looking out of the window at the sea. It was lunchtime, and none of the servants were in the main hall. Thoma was off in the capital, and Ayaka wasn't feeling hungry. The vision hunt had stalled, so the reports said. She had given up sleep multiple times over conversations with Yoyima, with community leaders who wanted to subtly protect their vision-bearers. Removing names from ledgers, hiding vision-beearers if the samurai visited, establishing cover identities. From the political end, the Kamisato Clan had failed utterly to repeal or even lessen the severity of the ruling. Ayato wasn't being particularly helpful, so the negotiations had fallen to her, much to her chagrin.
      
      But it was all so *prosaic*.
      
      What was she doing? Sitting here in her hall, one of the few vision-bearers left in a positoin of power; not even one that required a vision! All things considered, she was in a particularly powerful position. She was The One who would have to push for change, forcefully or not.
      
      But for all her hand-wringing, her mind had churned nothing out. She could feel her shoulders falling up past her body which felt too heavy, suddenly.
      
      ...she was hoping today's meeting would go well. A supposed hero had come to Inazuma with the Crux Fleet. In such company, it was hard to imagine that his arrival would go unnoticed by the Shogun. Thoma had been sent to greet
      
      Sitting behind the silk screen, Ayaka stared sullenly at the ceiling. She was to recieve a mysterious traveler, whose fame had crossed from the northern continent across the sea. Tidal waves had crashed against the Shogun's forcefield when Osial had awoken. It was rare for a natural disaster to be so severe as to reach Inazuma's shores--and Ayaka had found herself shuddering in disbelief at the towering walls of water crashing across a giant purple field--like the sky was falling.
      
      Weeks later, news of Liyue's great Jade Palace and it's fate was announced by the criers of the Shogun, the re-sealing of Osial declared.
      
      (Though of course she wasn't supposed to have known about the blonde hero, who had delayed the sea god. Or of Mondstadt's Dvalin and how it was carefully detained by the very same ridiculous--gods-be-damned story-book hero. But no one would notice if the informants from other nations seemed to be payed better than they otherwise should have.)
      
      Ayaka couldn't quite help herself and envisioned how convinient it would be to have all the civil problems of the Vision Hunt decree be eradicated, the rebellion be quelled (peacefully--that's what heroes did right?) It was quite to her surprise, when Thoma recounted The Crux Fleet Captain's gladitoral event, that it turned out some strange *blonde individual* had won and was coming to Inazuma.
      
      Pure luck that Thoma was the go-between with the Crux Fleet.
      
      And now, after weeks of preparation... the Traveler was finally about to arrive.
      
      Ayaka rolled her shoulders back, adjusted the way she sat on her legs, then fell forward over her knees and stretched. It had been a long day of waiting. The meetings today had come to and end early today, at least. She hadn't been able to sit still or focus the whole day--mentally preparing for this moment.
      
      This moment, that seemed to be dragging on forever.
      
      She sat back up, and finally completed the cycle: staring up at the ceiling.
      
      The door finally opened, and she could hear Thoma ushering. After a quiet scuffle, the door was promptly shut.
      
      "Good afternoon!" She sat straight, her hands on her thighs. A small smile crept across her face. She could hear the exclamations of a child, the Traveler's companion. "It is good to finally to make your acquaintence."
      
      "Thank you." She couldn't quite hear, but the soft voice might have umm-ed. "I was supposed to meet the `Shirasagi Himegimi`, are you..."
      
      "Yes, some call me that. I would prefer my clan's name, however, 'Kamisato'." She reached out and unwrapped the teapot from its cozy. "I must apologize for the conditions under which I must first recieve you, Traveler. This screen is a requirement, at least for our first conversation."
      
      "Yes, it was very kind of you to invite me." Again there was a sound of uncertainty.
      
      "Won't you tell me your name?"
      
      "...My name is Aether."
      
      "And my name's Paimon!" A high-pitched titter flew through the room. "I'm his friend!"
      
      Ayaka giggled. "I see, Paimon, friend of the Traveler. I can't wait to meet you face-to-face in our next meeting; you sound quite cute!"
      
      She lifted the spigot of the teapot back up. "Thoma? Could you give our guests their refreshments?"
      
      He came around and flashed her a quick smile of reassurance, and then disappeared around the curtain.
      
      "Welcome to Inazuma, I hope you found Ritou to be to your tastes." Ayaka took a sip from her own cup while the Traveler and his companion thanked Thoma. "You are aware of the current sanctions being placed on travelers like yourself. That, and the Sankoku Vision Decree."
      
      "While it is not the official position of the Kamisato clan, these policies are destroying our homeland. That is what *I* believe." Her voice came out louder than she had wanted. "Inazuma and its people are strong, but our trade with neighboring nations and the inspiration driven by our vision-bearers; to lose both sources of outside support in one fell-swoop was far too much."
      
      "The Mikage furnace has shut down, the entirety of Yashiori is beset by an evil spirit, of which I know little. War is being waged at our doorstep as we speak." Ayaka spread her arms in placation. "That being said, I do not intend for you to solve our problems for us."
      
      "What I have heard is that you are searching for your sister. Correct me if I'm wrong?" She let her hands fall back to her lap.
      
      The Traveler was slow to answer. As she waited behind her printed screen, she could feel the shifting of the boards beneath her legs--the Traveler shifting his weight. "That's right."
      
      
      "My clan has many resources with which to aid you, though I don't know what measures you have already taken. I myself would be willing to dedicate my own time to helping you in any way I could. The full force of the Kamisato clan would be at your disposal; I assure you."
      
      The Traveler's soft voice cut cleanly through the air. "I decline your offer. At least, as it stands."
      
      She felt her shoulders drop, "What... could I do to improve my offer?"
      
      "You need context, Miss Kamisato." The sigh in his voice fell heavy. "My sister was taken from me by a god, as near as I can figure. That is the first sense in which this is difficult. I don't know for what reason she was taken away, I didn't anticipate getting her back to be... easy."
      
      As amazing as all of that sounded, omething bothered her about that statement. "You 'didn't' anticipate?"
      
      "That's not *all* there is. That is..." His words fell off, and for an uncomfortably long time, the room sat in silence. "I ran into my sister about a month ago, accompanied by abyss Heralds."
      
      The room felt very cold all of a sudden; Ayaka felt herself be taken ahold of by the same silence that  gripped Thoma and Paimon.
      
      "In exchange for aiding our cause, you would ask us to fight the Abyss order?"
      "Not necessarily, I also need as much information as I can get. Both about the abyss order, and... well, I wouldn't mind having access to a fleet of librarians to help me scoure for something in particular. If your rebllion could agree to help me, however, that would be incredibly helpful, not just to me but to the rest of Teyvat."
